This project started as we needed an automatic reminder for our next dnd session. We created a poll on https://xoyondo.com/ and I wanted to extract those votes and try to find the ideal to play live/online.
But people playing in a dnd group know: not everybody is as hyped as you and not everybode can keep things up to date and so, this project came to an end.
We will continue to ask if everybody is available on friday, this tradition shall not break.
Good day.
